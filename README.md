# companycarbooking
A system that allows staff to book their company transportation for work purposes outside from office area.

This is a simple CRUD system that staff of a company can book a car and update their booking. Staff can view for available cars 
before booking. 
For admin role, admin can delete any bookings from staff that is wrong or not valid.

This is a very simple first project that I made during my internship.

Feel free to explore my codes, especially for beginners.
